These services lead to rapid innovation, flexible resources, and cost-efficiency. <a href='/data-center'>Cloud Data server providers in India</a> like <strong>The Abacus cloud</strong> allow you to store data on physical servers and these servers are taken care of by <strong>cloud computing service providers,</strong> thus eliminating the need for organisations to purchase, own and maintain their own physical data centers and servers. The facilities of data storage and computing power are made available to the user on-demand without any direct management by the user in the cloud computing.</p><p><strong>Cloud service companies in India</strong> follow a pay-as-you-go model, wherein users just need to pay for only those services which they are using. This model helps in lowering the operational cost and allows you to run your infrastructure more efficiently along with scaling resources as per the needs of your business.</p><h2>Who Uses Cloud Computing Services? </h2><p>Cloud computing services are for everyone whatever the type and size of organisation is because the services of <strong>cloud server providers</strong> prove to be helpful for multiple cases like for the purpose of data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, customer-facing web apps and big data analytics.</p><p>The organisations dealing with sensitive data usually need <strong>cloud server services</strong> for a variety of purposes like healthcare companies need them for more personalised treatments for patients, financial service providers require  <strong>cloud server hosting</strong> in order to provide real-time fraud detection and prevention. There are many other businesses which are using the services of<strong> cloud server agencies </strong> and some of them are given below.<br /><ul><li><strong>Pinterest:</strong>It uses <strong>cloud computing services</strong> in order to manage multiple petabytes of data which are being generated by its users on a regular basis.</li><li><strong>Spotify:</strong> Spotify makes use of <strong>cloud computing services</strong>  in order to get storage for a vast collection of songs.</li><li><strong>Netflix:</strong> The main purpose of using cloud services by Netflix is to allow users to watch shows while being in any corner of the world.</li></ul><br />There are a lot more companies which leverage cloud services for their own specific purpose. Even it would not be wrong to say that almost all the companies in today’s time need the services of cloud computing service providers for storing and managing their data without any need of investing in their own infrastructure.</p><h2>What Are Different Types of Cloud Computing Services?</h2><p>Cloud computing is classified on the basis of two models that are Deployment model and services model.These two models are further classified into the following categories-<br/><strong>Deployment Model:</strong><ul><li>Private Cloud</li><li>Public Cloud</li><li>Hybrid Cloud</li></ul></p><h3>Private Cloud:</h3><p>In private cloud services, resources are dedicated to a single business or organisation. In these services, the server is usually located on a company’s onsite data center but some also prefer to pay a third-party service provider for the purpose of hosting their private cloud. The management of private clouds is usually handled through internal resources without any access to anyone outside the organisation. These services are usually known for providing scalability, elasticity and additional security.</p><h3>Public Cloud:</h3><p><strong>Public cloud services</strong> of cloud server hosting providers are being operated by a third-party cloud services provider. In these, all the computing resources like server and storage are provided over the internet. Unlike private clouds, these can be  purchased by anyone and in these all the hardware, software and other types of infrastructure is owned and managed by cloud providers. Users just need to pay for the resources they are using, as a pay-as-you-go model is being followed.</p><h3>Hybrid Cloud:</h3><p>Hybrid cloud services are the combination of both public and private cloud.</p><strong>Services Model:</strong><p>Services model is classified into-<br/><ul><li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</li><li>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</li><li>Software as a Service (SaaS)</li></ul></p><h3>IaaS:</h3><p>Infrastructure as a service model is one of the most basic categories of cloud computing. Infrastructure as a service model is a kind of service where IT infrastructure like servers & VMs, storage, networks and operating system are being rented from a cloud service provider. Users have to pay for the resources they are using because of a pay-as-you go model.</p><h3>PaaS:</h3><p>In the platform as a service model, resources are being supplied to the users on demand. Users are being allowed to develop, test, deliver and manage software applications. It makes it easier for developers to create mobile apps and web apps without any tension of managing the underlying infra of servers, storage, network and databases required for the purpose of development.</p><h3>SaaS:</h3><p>Software as an application is the method of delivering software apps on the internet on the demand and on subscription. With this, cloud providers host and manage the software apps and underlying infrastructure. They also take on the responsibility of maintenance, software upgrades and security. In most of the cases, people referring to software as a service are referring to end-user applications.</p><h2>The Abacus Cloud Server Services Provider </h2><p>The Abacus is your premier destination, as here innovation is met with efficiency.
